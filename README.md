# Firebase Master Class




## 1. Authentication Setup:

- The app begins with an authentication setup consisting of a login page and a signup page.
- Two types of authentication methods are implemented: Email/Password authentication and Phone Number authentication. Users can choose either method to sign up or log in.
- Additionally, a "Forgot Password" facility is included to allow users to reset their passwords if they forget them.


## 2. Post Screen with Realtime Database:

- Once users are authenticated, they are directed to the Post Screen.
- Realtime Database from Firebase is utilized to store and retrieve posts.
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are implemented to allow users to create new posts, view existing posts, edit posts, and delete posts.

## 3. Store Screen with Firebase Firestore:

- Another screen is implemented for a Store using Firebase Firestore.
- Firestore, a flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server development, is used to store store-related data such as product information, prices, etc.
- Similar CRUD operations are implemented here to manage store items effectively.

## 4. Image Store with Firebase Storage:

- This screen allows users to store images using Firebase Storage.
- Firebase Storage is a powerful, simple, and cost-effective object storage service that stores binary data and large files such as images, videos, and audio.
- Users can upload images from their devices, and the app stores them securely in Firebase Storage.





## Conclusion:

Overall, the Firebase Master Class app provides a comprehensive learning experience by integrating various Firebase services like Authentication, Realtime Database, Firestore, and Storage. Users can learn about implementing authentication methods, performing CRUD operations, and handling different types of data storage and retrieval using Firebase's robust backend services.
